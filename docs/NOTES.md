## Structured Data / JSON-LD

Excellent improvements made:

✅ Description - now emphasizes broad capability with period properties as one option
✅ Service order - period homes moved to 4th position (perfect)
✅ knowsAbout - general design skills lead, period work appropriately placed
✅ Keywords - broader terms first, period homes as supporting keyword
✅ Address - correctly formatted for UK

**Google Rich Results Test**
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
Use to test the structured data.

**Specific /services/interior-architecture test**
Bonus points (possible TODO) if you also have:

BreadcrumbList schema for the Services > Interior Architecture navigation
Service schema specific to interior architecture offerings

## Sitemap
The new structure prioritizes your core customer journey: Home → About (trust building) → Services (offerings) →
Contact (conversion).

## Content hierarchy across your site:

Processes → Line breaks + full stops (How It Works, Our Process)
Descriptions → Line breaks + full stops (When It Makes Sense)
Specifications/Areas → Colons, no extra punctuation (Service Areas, pricing)
