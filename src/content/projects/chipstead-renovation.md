This home bursts with life, and we wanted to create bold story of colour and pattern that reflected the homeowners' vibrant personalities. We included a range of bold wallpapers and balanced these with carefully selected paint colours to ensure the finished look was modern and exciting.

Bold lighting paired with beautiful furniture creates the perfect balance between period charm and modern style.  The finished scheme resulted in a beautiful family home which reflected the exuberant and fun personalities of its owners.
