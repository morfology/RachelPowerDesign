# We renovated a tired house transforming it into a modern family home giving new life to the outdated space. By updating the layout, incorporating contemporary design elements, and improving functionality, the badly designed house is now a stylish and comfortable haven. With careful planning and creative vision, we blended contemporary aesthetics with functional design  to revitalise the property.  We have created a beautiful, functional space that meets the families evolving  needs.
# Rachel was excellent. She was extremely friendly, took time to understand our brief, and worked closely to our budget and style. She was also extremely flexible and we are absolutely delighted with the finished works. She was able to recommend a team to carry out the work we required who were also excellent.

We transformed a dated and poorly designed house into a stylish, functional family home. Through thoughtful reconfiguration of the layout, contemporary design elements, and a focus on livability, the once-tired space has been reimagined as a welcoming and modern sanctuary.

Every detail was carefully considered — from enhancing flow and functionality to introducing a refined aesthetic that balances comfort with clean, modern lines. The result is a beautifully cohesive home tailored to meet the evolving needs of a modern family.

<Testimonial link="https://www.houzz.co.uk/viewReview/1863397/rachel-power-design-review">
We found Rachel on Google like many, but after our first meeting I knew she totally got what we were after. If you are looking for a friendly, creative, detailed perfectionist of a designer - then look no further. Rachel got our style straight away, seeing that we wanted a stylish but practical home for a family with young children. And my goodness she delivered. Along with the PM team she works closely with Rachel’s designs have become a reality.
At every stage of design, product ideas through to the finishing touches of plants and cushions her eye for detail is incredible. Communication is excellent and always happy to look for alternatives. Thank you Rachel- we could not be happier with the house, on to phase 2 next year!
