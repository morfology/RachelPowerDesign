We created a warm, sophisticated and inviting home that fused the different elements of taste and culture of these international clients.  The two storey extension and house renovation created a spacious home with light filled rooms perfect for entertaining and enjoying family life.

<Testimonial>
We had a two story house fully decorated by Rachel. She designed it and helped us to decorate all the rooms from the beginning to the end. She understood exactly what I wanted and delivered a fantastic job.
