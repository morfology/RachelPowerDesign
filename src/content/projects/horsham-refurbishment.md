Contemporary, understated style was the brief from our clients in Horsham.  Focusing on a neutral colour palette we combined textures and materials to create a cosy environment which provides the perfect balance of sophistication and comfort.  Colour also had a part to play in the overall scheme with a concise collection of colours being integrated into the designs.
