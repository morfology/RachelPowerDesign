Our full interior design service is perfect for people looking to build a new house, renovate an existing property or simply update certain areas of their home.

Working together we will create your dream home which embodies the perfect balance between form and function.
Our interior design service works on the basis of providing a full design pack taking you from concept to completion therefore ensuring all aspects of the design are fully integrated.

We offer a highly personalised service, designing a beautiful interior which reflects each client's personal style and desires.  By working closely with you we are able to ensure that every detail is considered ensuring that your home is tailored to you.

Our interior design service is made up of the following stages :

#### BRIEF

Discovery Call - This is a brief call to discuss your plans and understand more about your requirements, budget and timeframe.

Initial Meeting - We will arrange an 1-2-1 meeting in your home to discuss your needs and aspirations for your home in greater detail.  You will have been provided with a questionnaire prior to this meeting to allow you to detail your key wants and ambitions for the design.

Property Survey - Once you have engaged our services we will complete a full property survey to ensure total accuracy on the scale plans and detailed drawings.  This will also be an opportunity to discuss any other design elements in more detail.


#### CONCEPT

Once the designs have been approved the project will be handed over to the project management team who will oversee the renovation/build phase.  They will work in conjunction with the design team to ensure the designs are executed correctly.
