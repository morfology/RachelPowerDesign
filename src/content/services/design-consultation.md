If you have ideas of what you would like to do in your home but are struggling to make decisions, or you want to make a change but have no idea where to start, a design consultation could be the answer. 

Either online or in person you will have a one-to-one meeting with Rachel during which we will be able to assist with your design dilemmas and provide solutions. 

We will also provide a follow-up document detailing everything discussed and all relevant information to help you action the new design scheme.

Areas which can be covered during the consultation include:

- Space Planning
- Lighting decisions
- Paint and wallpaper choices
- Options for furniture and decorative items
- Hard finishes such as flooring, tiles and hardware
- Window treatments
- Storage and joinery advice
- Room styling, soft furnishings and accessories

In-person consultations are available within a 30 mile radius of Farnham, Surrey. For areas outside this radius additional travelling time will be charged.
