- Follow established style guide for consistency
- Focus on user intent, not just keywords
- Create helpful, actionable content

### Misc

- [ ] Some project pages might benefit from unique images in the og:image tags instead of the default og-default.png. Project-specific images could improve social media click-through rates.
- [ ] The testimonials on each page are valuable for SEO but aren't being leveraged in the meta descriptions. You could test adding brief credibility indicators like "award-winning" or "5-star rated" if appropriate.
- [ ] Consider adding location-specific schema markup if you haven't already, especially for the Farnham projects.
