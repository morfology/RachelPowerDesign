## Structured Data / JSON-LD

Excellent improvements made:

✅ Description - now emphasizes broad capability with period properties as one option
✅ Service order - period homes moved to 4th position (perfect)
✅ knowsAbout - general design skills lead, period work appropriately placed
✅ Keywords - broader terms first, period homes as supporting keyword
✅ Address - correctly formatted for UK

**Google Rich Results Test**
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
Use to test the structured data.

**Specific /services/interior-architecture test**
Bonus points (possible TODO) if you also have:

BreadcrumbList schema for the Services > Interior Architecture navigation
Service schema specific to interior architecture offerings

## Sitemap
The new structure prioritizes your core customer journey: Home → About (trust building) → Services (offerings) →
Contact (conversion).

## Content hierarchy across your site:

Processes → Line breaks + full stops (How It Works, Our Process)
Descriptions → Line breaks + full stops (When It Makes Sense)
Specifications/Areas → Colons, no extra punctuation (Service Areas, pricing)

## SEO Location Strategy "Farnham" in projects

> There are several "Farnham" projects and only one includes it on the path. I shied away as wanting to emphasise other locations too, but maybe it should include the location anyway, for SEO? Secondly, I always wanted to change /tags to /location, purely for SEO i.e. WestSussex, Surrey, etc. Is this worth the squeeze?

**On Farnham locations in descriptions:**
You should absolutely include Farnham in the descriptions even if the URL paths don't include it. Local SEO is powerful for service businesses - people search "interior designer Farnham" or "home renovation Farnham" regularly. Since you have multiple Farnham projects, this actually strengthens your local authority. The URL structure is less critical than the meta descriptions for local search visibility.

**On changing /tags to /location:**
This change has merit but the ROI might not justify the effort. Here's the breakdown:

**Pros:**
- URLs like `/location/west-sussex` or `/location/surrey` would be more SEO-friendly for local searches
- More intuitive for users browsing by area
- Could help with "interior design West Sussex" type searches

**Cons:**
- You'd need 301 redirects from all existing `/tags` URLs to avoid losing SEO juice
- Risk of temporarily losing rankings during the transition
- Time investment in implementation and testing
- Tags might serve other non-location purposes that would be lost

**Alternative approach:**
Keep `/tags` but create dedicated location pages (`/areas/west-sussex`, `/areas/surrey`) that showcase projects by region. This gives you the local SEO benefit without disrupting existing structure.

The location descriptions in meta tags will likely give you more immediate SEO impact than changing the URL structure. Focus on consistently mentioning locations in your project descriptions first - that's lower risk, higher reward.
