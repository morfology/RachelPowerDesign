#> Absolutely thrilled with how our home was transformed!

Our brief here was to add personality to the ground floor of this Farnham home which had been newly built.  With the addition of new furniture pieces, lighting and a range of accessories and artwork we created the perfect balance between old and new.  The end result was a home full of personality and perfect for family nights and fun with friends.
