We found Rachel on Google like many, but after our first meeting I knew she totally got what we were after. If you are looking for a friendly, creative, detailed perfectionist of a designer - then look no further. Rachel got our style straight away, seeing that we wanted a stylish but practical home for a family with young children. And my goodness she delivered.
