description: "Everything at Rachel Power Design is built on relationships and these are our main priority.  From our handpicked collection of skilled trades, artisans and craft people to the close bond we build with our clients, every relationship matters and is a fundamental part of our success.|We believe that every project needs to start with a conversation.  To understand a client's vision we need to get to know them, their lifestyle and passions and what inspires them.  It is important we understand all of this to ensure we present ideas and designs which work for each individual client providing a fully bespoke solution."
