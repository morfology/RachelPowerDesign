# Content Style Guide - Rachel Power Design

## Punctuation & Formatting Standards

### Bold Headers with Content

Use consistent formatting based on content type:

#### Process Steps & Service Descriptions
Use line breaks + full stops for complete, authoritative statements:

```markdown
**Initial Consultation**  
We start with a thorough assessment of your current space, lifestyle needs, and aspirations.

**Space Analysis & Concept Development**  
Using our expertise in spatial planning, we explore multiple layout options.
```

#### Specifications & Reference Information
Use colons for label-style information (no additional punctuation needed):

```markdown
**In-person consultations:** Available within 30 miles of Farnham, Surrey
**Areas covered:** Surrey, West Sussex, Hampshire, and South West London
**Online consultations:** Available anywhere in the UK
```

#### Concept Explanations
Use hyphens when explaining or elaborating on concepts:

```markdown
**Fully Integrated Process** - Every element is designed to work together
**Budget Transparency** - Detailed costings at each stage so you're informed
```

### Content Lists

#### Client-Focused Descriptions
Use bold lead-ins with natural flow (no bullets needed):

```markdown
**Growing families** who need more space but love their location.  
**Period properties** where original layouts don't suit modern living.  
**Awkward layouts** with poor flow or wasted space.
```

**Why this works:**
- Feels conversational and welcoming
- Creates "we understand you" connection
- Easy to scan without feeling like a checklist

#### Technical/Service Lists
Use bullet points only for purely factual or technical information:

```markdown
**Key areas we address:**
- **Space planning and flow** - optimising room layouts and connections
- **Structural modifications** - removing or adding walls, opening up spaces  
- **Extension planning** - single and double-storey additions
```

## Line Breaks in Markdown

### Two Spaces Method (Preferred)
Add two spaces at end of line + single newline:
```markdown
Line one  
Line two  
Line three
```

### Alternative Methods
- Backslash + newline: `Line one\`
- HTML breaks: `Line one<br>`
- Double newlines for paragraph breaks

## Content Hierarchy Patterns

### Page Structure
- **H2 (##)** - Main section headers
- **H3 (###)** - Subsection headers  
- **Bold** - Process steps, key concepts, labels
- *Italic* - Additional context, pricing notes

### Content Types by Format

| Content Type | Format | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Process steps | Line break + full stop | **Step Name**<br>Description. |
| Service specs | Colon format | **Service:** Description |
| Concept explanations | Hyphen format | **Concept** - Explanation |
| Client types | Bold + natural flow | **Client type** description. |

## Consistency Guidelines

### Always Use Full Stops For:
- Process descriptions
- Service explanations  
- Client-focused content
- Any complete statement after a line break

### Never Use Full Stops For:
- Specifications with colons
- Short reference information
- Contact-style details

### Avoid Bullets For:
- Client-focused marketing content
- Conversational descriptions
- Content that should feel welcoming rather than clinical

### Use Bullets For:
- Technical specifications
- Feature lists
- Purely factual information

## Voice & Tone

### Professional but Approachable
- Use "we" not "I" 
- Direct, confident language
- Avoid overly casual or overly formal extremes

### Client-Focused Language
- Address client needs and concerns directly
- Use "your" frequently
- Focus on outcomes and benefits

### Expertise Positioning
- Demonstrate knowledge without being intimidating
- Use specific terminology appropriately
- Back up claims with process details
