A melting pot of cultures and tastes this home
Marrying the tastes of these international clients we created a warm, sophisticated and inviting home that blended different elements of taste and culture.  The two storey extension and house renovation created a spacious home with light filled rooms perfect for entertaining and enjoying family life.

<Testimonial>
  Rachel was excellent. She was extremely friendly, took time to understand our brief, and worked closely to our budget and style. She was also extremely flexible and we are absolutely delighted with the finished works. She was able to recommend a team to carry out the work we required who were also excellent.
