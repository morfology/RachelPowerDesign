# We renovated a tired house transforming it into a modern family home giving new life to the outdated space. By updating the layout, incorporating contemporary design elements, and improving functionality, the badly designed house is now a stylish and comfortable haven. With careful planning and creative vision, we blended contemporary aesthetics with functional design  to revitalise the property.  We have created a beautiful, functional space that meets the families evolving  needs.

We transformed a dated and poorly designed house into a stylish, functional family home. Through thoughtful reconfiguration of the layout, contemporary design elements, and a focus on livability, the once-tired space has been reimagined as a welcoming and modern sanctuary.

Every detail was carefully considered â€” from enhancing flow and functionality to introducing a refined aesthetic that balances comfort with clean, modern lines. The result is a beautifully cohesive home tailored to meet the evolving needs of a modern family.

  Rachel was excellent. She was extremely friendly, took time to understand our brief, and worked closely to our budget and style. She was also extremely flexible and we are absolutely delighted with the finished works. She was able to recommend a team to carry out the work we required who were also excellent.
